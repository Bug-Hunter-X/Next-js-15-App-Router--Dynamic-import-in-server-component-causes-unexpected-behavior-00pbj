# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic import in server component causes unexpected behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using dynamic imports within server components in Next.js 15's App Router.  The issue arises when a dynamic import is used inside a component that's rendered on the server; the behavior differs from what's expected based on the documentation and intended functionality.

## Bug Description
The problem involves inconsistencies and unexpected results when a dynamic component is imported within a server component.  Under certain conditions, the dynamic import may fail, or the component may not render correctly, leading to a broken user experience. This issue particularly highlights challenges around server-side rendering and the lifecycle of dynamic imports in this new architecture.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.

## Expected Behavior
The dynamically imported component should render seamlessly as part of the server-side rendered page.

## Actual Behavior
The dynamically imported component may not render correctly, leading to a broken layout or incomplete rendering.

## Potential Solutions
Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact cause and determine the most effective solution.  Options may include:

* Adjustments to the dynamic import strategy.
* Modifications to the component's lifecycle.
* Alternative approaches to handling dynamic components within server components.

This issue is critical for understanding the limitations and best practices of using dynamic imports within Next.js 15's server components.
